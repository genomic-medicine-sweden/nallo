### Ranked variants

#### Filter_vep

[filter_vep from VEP](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/script/vep_filter.html) is used to subset the variants based on a list of HGNC ID:s. Typical use case is that you want to filter your results to only include variants in a predefined set of clinically relevant genes. This step is optional and can be disabled by using the flag `--skip_vep_filter`. You will always get the complete VCF together with the clinical VCF.

#### GENMOD

[GENMOD](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/genmod) is a simple to use command line tool for annotating and analyzing genomic variations in the VCF file format. GENMOD can annotate genetic patterns of inheritance in vcf files with single or multiple families of arbitrary size. Each variant will be assigned a predicted pathogenicity score. The score will be given both as a raw score and a normalized score with values between 0 and 1. The tags in the INFO field are `RankScore` and `RankScoreNormalized`. The score can be configured to fit your annotations and preferences by modifying the score config file.
