## Introduction

**genomic-medicine-sweden/nallo** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline for long-reads from both PacBio and (targeted) ONT-data, focused on rare-disease. Heavily influenced by best-practice pipelines such as [nf-core/sarek](https://nf-co.re/sarek), [nf-core/raredisease](https://nf-co.re/raredisease), [nf-core/nanoseq](https://github.com/nf-core/nanoseq), [PacBio Human WGS Workflow](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pb-human-wgs-workflow-snakemake), [epi2me-labs/wf-human-variation](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-human-variation) and [brentp/rare-disease-wf](https://github.com/brentp/rare-disease-wf).
