## Introduction

**genomic-medicine-sweden/nallo** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline for long-read rare disease SV/SNV identification using both PacBio and (targeted) ONT-data. Heavily influenced by best-practice pipelines such as [nf-core/nanoseq](https://github.com/nf-core/nanoseq), [nf-core/sarek](https://nf-co.re/sarek), [nf-core/raredisease](https://nf-co.re/raredisease), [PacBio Human WGS Workflow](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pb-human-wgs-workflow-snakemake), [epi2me-labs/wf-human-variation](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-human-variation) and [brentp/rare-disease-wf](https://github.com/brentp/rare-disease-wf).

## Pipeline summary

##### QC

- FastQC ([`FastQC`](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
- Aligned read QC ([`cramino`](https://github.com/wdecoster/cramino))
- Depth information ([`mosdepth`](https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth))

##### Alignment & assembly

- Align reads to reference ([`minimap2`](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2))
- Assemble (trio-binned) haploid genomes (HiFi only) ([`hifiasm`](https://github.com/chhylp123/hifiasm))

##### Variant calling

- Short variant calling & joint genotyping of SNVs ([`deepvariant`](https://github.com/google/deepvariant) + [`GLNexus`](https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus))
- SV calling and joint genotyping ([`sniffles2`](https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles))
- Tandem repeats (HiFi only) ([`TRGT`](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/trgt/tree/main))
- Assembly based variant calls (HiFi only) ([`dipcall`](https://github.com/lh3/dipcall))
- CNV-calling (HiFi only) ([`HiFiCNV`](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/HiFiCNV))
- Call paralogous genes ([`Paraphase`](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/paraphase))

##### Phasing and methylation

- Phase and haplotag reads ([`whatshap`](https://github.com/whatshap/whatshap) + [`hiphase`](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/HiPhase))
- Methylation pileups ([`modkit`](https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit))

##### Annotation - SNV

- Annotate variants with database(s) of choice, i.e. [gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org), [CADD](https://cadd.gs.washington.edu) etc. ([`echtvar`](https://github.com/brentp/echtvar) and [`VEP`](https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-vep))

##### Filtering and ranking

- Rank variants ([`GENMOD`](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/genmod))

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

Prepare a samplesheet with input data:

`samplesheet.csv`

```
sample,file,family_id,paternal_id,maternal_id,sex,phenotype
HG002,/path/to/HG002.fastq.gz,FAM1,HG003,HG004,1,2
HG005,/path/to/HG005.bam,FAM1,HG003,HG004,2,1
```

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run genomic-medicine-sweden/nallo -profile YOURPROFILE \
    --input samplesheet.csv \
    --preset <revio/pacbio/ONT_R10> \
    --fasta <reference.fasta> \
    --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://github.com/genomic-medicine-sweden/nallo/blob/dev/docs/usage.md).

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

To run in an offline environment, download the pipeline and singularity images using [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use):

```
nf-core download genomic-medicine-sweden/nallo
```
