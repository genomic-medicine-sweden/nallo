# Introduction

There are pipelines available for analysis of long-read data such as [nf-core/nanoseq](https://nf-co.re/nanoseq). There's [nf-core/sarek] for detection of variants in WGS data.
[nf-core/raredisease](https://nf-co.re/raredisease) is under development, but also focused on WGS/WES data. However, is there any pipeline incorporating SV and SNP-calls to find rare diseases in long-read data, using a set of known variants derived from PacBio HiFi data? Otherwise:
